# Papers for Knowledge-driven Applications
How to integrate symbolic knowledge into the computational framework of real-world applications remains a big challenge. There is a list of papers for knowledge-driven applications in recent years, including the review of knowledge graphs, knowledge-aware text generation, recommendation, knowledge inference and so on.
